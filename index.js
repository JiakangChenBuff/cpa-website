    text: `If you pay attention to the news, you’ve probably heard the word “anarchist” a whole bunch lately. But honestly? I doubt any of America’s mainstream politicians have used “anarchist” correctly in their speeches this year. So what exactly are anarchists? What is anarchism? Anarchists, in the words of the Anarchist Library Organization, are basically “anti-authoritarians”. Although different types of anarchy focus on different topics such as evolution, pacifism, or religion, their ideology is based around questioning ‘irrational authority’. What’s that? Let’s look at the meaning of that term. <br><br>

Anarchists focus on the difference between having authority and being authority. To be an authority, you have to be experienced in your field. As an authority, you can be trusted to give advice on what you’re competent in. This is authority that forms from logical reasoning - you are good in this subject, so you’re qualified to give advice on it. People are free to ignore what you say, of course, but you’re there to help and guide them whenever needed. That’s rational authority. Anyone can have authority, but that doesn’t mean they deserve it. Having authority means that you take the position of the commander in order to command people under you. You can be the least competent person in what you do, and yet if you are in a position of power (like a boss), you still have that authority. You’re not an authority, but you’ve got the position and the ranking to command those under you however you please. That’s irrational authority.<br><br>

One example of irrational authority would be any sort of hierarchy. In a hierarchy, there’s always people above you who’re going to push down on you. Unless you’re at the very top, it’d be in your best interest to obey whatever the upper class says, because otherwise you would be punished - prison, a criminal record, and so on. Because you’re held in obedience by this threat of negative effects, you’re not actually acknowledging the authority because they are qualified in what they do. You’re obeying them because they have the power to give you orders and impose laws, and punish you if you don’t follow them. That’s why anarchists see any hierarchy as irrational.<br><br>

You see the “state” talked about a lot in anarchist philosophy, too. It’s not talking about a specific state, like California or Oregon or New York, though. The “state” just means a centralized government which uses force, violence, and hierarchy to enforce its authority...so any country’s government, essentially. The “state” is always considered irrational authority among anarchists.<br><br>

What are some key concepts in anarchism? Let’s take a look at the ones listed by the Anarchist Library:<br><br>

Anti-authoritarianism: anarchists focus on questioning irrational authority and destroying any form of hierarchy in society.<br><br>

Free association: people should have the freedom to associate and disassociate with whomever they choose at any time, instead of being forced to interact with certain groups of people out of irrational authority.<br><br>

Mutual aid: anarchists believe that people should lend aid and voluntary help to one another without a motive to conquer or rise in rank.<br><br>

Freedom: this one is pretty simple! Freedom is just the capability to control your own life, instead of being instructed by irrational authority.<br><br>

Self management: in society, people’s governance should be formed from equal say instead of handing certain individuals authority.<br><br>

Egalitarianism (total equality): “Egalitarianism” is just a fancy word for total equality. But this isn’t your average YA-novel dystopian “equality” where everyone is forced to be the exact clone of one another. Anarchists believe that egalitarianism comes from destroying wealth and power inequality, which is brought about by bringing down hierarchy.<br><br>

Feminism: All anarchists advocate for gender equality. And I mean all. It’s really the bare minimum.<br><br>

There’s obviously no push for you to agree with anarchism, of course! But it would be useful to know the correct definition when you hear our politicians talk about “anarchists and looters”, right? Anarchy isn’t just a general term to be thrown around. It describes a complex philosophy that has, and will, continue to influence the world as we know it.`,

    text: `Have you ever wondered where the oil in your car comes from? No, not just the gas station - where does that oil really come from? And how is it obtained? One way that companies mine oil and gas is through fracking. “Fracking”, or hydraulic fracturing, is used to harvest fossil fuels that are trapped inside sedimentary rocks.<br><br>

In hydraulic fracturing, a deep well is drilled into the ground. Steel pipes with holes, called casings, are inserted into the well. Fracking fluid is then blasted through these holes. The high pressures created from the pumping of fracking fluid “fractures” the rock to gain access to the trapped oil and gas. Fracking uses equipment like fluid pumps, blenders to mix the fracking fluid, and storage units for different parts of the fluid (water, chemicals, and sand).<br><br>

You might think that fracking is a fast way of harvesting fuel that benefits the economy - and you’d be right! Fracking has helped lower costs of oil and provide people with better access to energy. However, it has other not-so-great effects on both the environment and us. According to the United States Geological Survey, one fracking well can use from 1.5 million to 16 million gallons of water. This amount continues to increase - a study from Duke University suggests that between 2011 and 2016, the amount of water used per fracking well grew by a lot. In West Texas, it increased by up to 770%!<br><br>

Fracking also contaminates the environment. It can pollute drinking water sources through fracking fluid leakage, weak well structure, and drilling mistakes. In addition to producing methane, fracking adds to air pollution by releasing toxic gases that have been linked to lung and heart damage, birth defects, cancer, and neurological problems. Workers on-site during fracking operations are at higher risk because they are closest to the toxic gases released.<br><br>

People living near fracking sites can be in danger from its effects on fault lines. The United States Geological Survey has found a correlation between disposal wells, used in oil and gas operations like fracking, and the increasing frequency of earthquakes in the central United States. This is because the massive amounts of pressure produced during fracking can also shift fault lines to cause earthquakes.<br><br>

While fracking is effective for mining fossil fuels, its negative effects have made it a topic of discussion in the United States. Many people believe that fracking should be restricted, or even banned, because of how harmful it is to the environment. Others argue that its benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Despite the debate that surrounds it, hydraulic fracturing has definitely impacted the United States in irreversible ways.`,

    text: `If you’ve ever been to the zoo, it’s more than likely that you’ve seen many animals that could once only be found across the world. Think rhinos, elephants, tigers, leopards, sea turtles, and even orangutans! Although they’re fun to watch and learn about from behind the glass exhibition window, these animals share a tragic fact: they’re all victims of poaching, a dangerous and illegal activity that threatens the wellbeing of animals across the planet. What is poaching? Poaching is the illegal hunting of wild animals, often for either sport or market demand. It’s estimated by the Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network, TRAFFIC, that the trade resulting from poaching is likely worth billions of dollars. The World Bank takes this approximation further and sets it at a range of 5-23 billion dollars per year. It’s no minor matter. About 60% of elephants face their deaths at the hands of poachers - which isn’t a surprise, given the statistic that ivory hunters kill about 96 elephants daily in Africa. In South Africa alone, where the largest population of rhinos in the world reside, there was a 9000% increase in poaching between 2007 and 2014. That’s about 90 times the original rate in 2007.<br><br>

Illegal wildlife hunting poses a major threat to many countries in Asia and Africa. For example, there’s Botswana, which has about a third of Africa’s elephants; India, whose animals like tigers are locked in the target of poachers; and Mozambique, where lack of infrastructure and preventive legislation gives poachers the advantage in their hunts for ivory and rhino horn. It is also a problem, though to a lesser extent, in the USA and other Western countries.<br><br>

Modern day poaching is driven by the ever-increasing demand for wildlife products. Whether for tools, goods, or treasure, people demand access to these resources with little regard for how it affects the animals themselves. Rhino and elephant ivory remain some of the main resources trafficked today. Ivory is wanted by people across the world for a number of reasons. It has value as a luxury material, but it is also used as medicine or for its believed spiritual properties. For instance, in Vietnam there has arisen a myth that rhino horn can cure cancer. Tigers are also a frequent victim of poaching. They’re hunted for both their pelts, which are a luxury like ivory, and their bones, which are believed to have medicinal and spiritual properties by many. Tiger poaching is mostly headed by organized crime rather than individual hunters, and it brings in about 19 billion US dollars a year. Poachers even go after sea turtle eggs because they can be sold in the illegal market, and oftentimes eaten as a delicacy. According to People Not Poaching, over 90% of turtle eggs are destroyed for the wildlife trade at beaches that don’t have protective regulations against poaching.<br><br>

Although poaching brings in a lot of money for its participants, it comes at heavy costs for everyone else. It goes without saying that poaching destroys the environment. First, it’s killing animals at unnatural rates. Illegal wildlife hunting imbalances food webs and destabilizes ecosystems across the globe. The amur leopard, for example, is registered as critically endangered in part because of its being targeted by poachers. Second, poachers also bring nonnative species with them into regions when they’re hunting. This introduces invasive flora and fauna that further disrupt the environment and local competition. The negative impacts on diversity of wildlife in regions also affects local communities, who rely on those animals to sustain their cultures, traditions, and even general survival.`,

    text: `Up to now, India is documented to have a 1.9% vaccination rate. This proved to be devastating news for India when the first strain of B.1.617 was uncovered in Maharashtra, India on October 5, 2020. B.1.617, sometimes referred to as the ‘Double Mutant,’ is a novel variant of Covid-19. In the media, B.1.617 dubbed as the ‘Double Mutant,’ because it has developed into two more main types of mutations. However, while there are two main types, there are a sum of 13 smaller mutations as of now.<br><br>

Worldwide, B.1.617 has become notorious for being responsible for the fastest surge of Covid-19 cases in India. In accordance, hospital space has become ever more valuable as it wanes, often resulting with overfilled hospitals. Perhaps this sign was the prelude to a record of 390,000 B.1.617 cases. Furthermore, in conformity with The Wall Street Journal, the B.1.617 variant has become the cause of over 3,600 deaths. This is partially due to the fact that B.1.617 is known for having a higher chance of dodging the defences of our immune systems, at least according to NPR. Ravi Gupta of Cambridge University has also mentioned the notion that our current vaccines are less competent on the new variant compared to previous strains. With all this in mind, it doesn’t come as a surprise to discover that B.1.617 has already become the dominant variant in India. In fact, pursuant to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, as of January to March of 2021, at least 60% of the cases in the Indian state of Maharashtra were of the new mutant variety. There was even worse news for the whole country. For them, by March 25, a staggering 70.4% of the collected Covid samples were B.1.617.<br><br>

As with the nature of the virus, B.1.617 has extended elsewhere. For example, several cases unfurled in the U.S., U.K., South Africa, and China. In total, by April 2021, at least 21 countries were already hit. This rapid surge has led numerous nations to ban the incoming travel from India. This regulation applies to the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany, and France. Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, have gone to the degree to begin threatening to jail or heavily fine travelers from India.<br><br>

While Covid-19 is indeed alleviating in many places, it is still actively participating and mutating in many countries. Thus, it would be advised to stay keen for the health of yourself and those around you. Help by spreading awareness and reminding your friends and family to stay alert and follow professionally set health procedures. Stay safe. Stay healthy.`,

    text: `When the UN Plan of 1948 declared Israel for Jews and Palestine for Arabs, the Jews accepted the idea and recognized the independence of Israel. However, the Arabs rejected the plan. They saw it as European colonialism. Then they declared war on Israel. Unexpectedly, Israel triumphed in the war. With the benefits of victory, Israel even extended its boundaries past those from the original UN plan. A ceasefire, also known as the “Green Line,” line was set. Additionally, Jordan had taken parts of Palestine during the war, including Jerusalem’s Old City—the holy city for many religions. This part conquered by Jordan became known as the West Bank.<br><br>

In 1967, Israel declared another war, which became known as the Six-Day War. As the name suggests the war ended fast. However, Israel entirely altered the Green Line and subjugated the West Bank. Then, Israel’s move to annex Jerusalem to itself pulled it to the center of dispute. Israel identified Jerusalem as “Unified Jerusalem '' and its new capital. Many Jewish civilians viewed it as a religious victory. The West Bank was a destination with long Jewish history and profound biblical significance. It was also home to the holy sites of Judea and Samaria.<br><br>

Naturally, the newly conquered Palestinians were vehemently upset with the new order. Israel, who was well aware of this, tried to preempt a Palestinian state independence by initiating a firm Jewish occupancy in East Jerusalem. To do this, Israel subsidized the building of 12 vast settlements in East Palestine. By 1977s, there were 38 settlements. Israel then encouraged Jewish settlers by establishing financial motivation. The settlements were well built and funded. In fact, one-third of all Jewish settlers migrated for monetary reasons. Additionally, there were the individual settlers whose objective for leaving was religious significance. All in all, it ended with an exodus of Jews who left to encroach the West Bank.<br><br>
Numerous countries denounced this migration, including the UN. The UN soon published a resolution, fundamentally communicating that the settlements were illicit and would disturb the Middle East’s collaborative peace. Despite the UN’s denouncement, the West Bank’s Jewish population grew. Palestinians abhorred what they saw as an obtrusion. Unrest became common. A prime example would be the 1929 incident in which the Arabs massacred Jews.<br><br>

Then, in the 1990’s Bill Clinton of America, Prime Minister Yizhak Rabin of Israel, and Yasser Arafat of Palestine agreed upon the Oslo Accords, which initiated a Palestinian government and split West Bank in to three regions. The first type of type of region, Area A, allowed total Palestinian rule over governmental and security related business. In other words, the regions that were considered Area A were allowed to self-govern. An approximate 18% of the West Bank is composed of Area A. This is where bulk of the Palestinian population resides. The second type of government, Area B, is only authorized to have governmental control over its population. In this type, Israel took on security control, namely military control. This comprises 21% of the West Bank. The last type of government, Area C, is entirely under Israel’s military and governmental control. This made up 60% of the West Bank. This 60% is where most of the people, by means most of the Jewish, and natural resources reside.<br><br>

Most notably, Area C is where most of the minerals, agricultural regions, water, and other natural resources lay. However, since Area C is entirely under Israel’s authority, and many Palestinian companies were forced to follow strict restrictions and guidelines in order to retrieve the natural resources, resulting in a severe hit to the Palestinian economy.<br><br>

In 2005, an important mark in Israeli history, Israel’s Prime Minister Ariel Sharon evicted at least 9000 settlers, 25 settlements, from the Gaza Strip, another Palestinian territory. This ejection stimulated the rise of settler migration to the West Bank. In fact, so many Israelis migrated to the West Bank that 5% of the entire Israel population now resides in the West Bank. Palestinian animosity has grown over years over their disadvantages and forced annexation. In recent days, this friction has reignited and has been shown through the forms of bombing and protests.`,

    text: `Have you ever been scuba diving? From personal experience, I think it’s pretty breathtaking (quite literally if you inhale the saltwater) and definitely worth a shot if you ever get the chance after lockdown. In addition to the fish, scuttling crabs, and lumbering turtles, you can also view one of the ocean’s greatest masterpieces while scuba diving: coral reefs. They’re colorful, beautiful, home to thousands of tiny animals - and also dying more and more by the year.<br><br>

Why is this happening?<br><br>

To start off, let’s explain what coral reefs are exactly. Coral reefs are ocean ecosystems formed by coral polyps, small organisms related to anemone and jellyfish. When these polyps attach themselves to hard surfaces underwater, they begin to multiply and expand into larger structures - which we know as coral reefs. These reefs are primarily built of the polyps’ calcium carbonate exoskeletons, but parts of other organisms like the shells of coralline algae and spicules of sponges become part of the ecosystem’s foundational structure as these organisms settle on the reef. Coral reefs typically grow in one of three patterns: fringing, atoll, or barrier. Fringing reefs are the most common, and they grow from the shoreline to the water. Atoll reefs grow from underwater volcanic islands, and they’re usually circular with a lagoon at their centers. Barrier reefs border shorelines but they don’t directly touch the shore like a fringing reef; rather, there is often a lagoon separating the land from the barrier reef.<br><br>

Due to a number of environmental issues, coral reefs have been in decline for over half a century. According to the reef conservation group Secore, more than 50% of the world’s coral reefs have died in the past three decades alone, and it’s very unlikely that this trend will stop anytime soon.<br><br>

Coral reefs are being damaged by multiple factors:<br><br>

Man-caused damage: This includes coastal construction, careless fishing procedures, dredging, boat anchors, and touching or breaking coral by use of hands.<br><br>

Pollution: This is most often pollution that transfers from land to water - sedimentation from agriculture, excess nutrients from fertilizers, pathogens from sewage, toxic materials from chemicals and pesticides, trash and microplastics.<br><br>

Overfishing: Excessive fishing causes imbalances in marine ecosystems, including removing fish that are responsible for cleaning algae off of coral reefs for optimal growth.<br><br>

Coral harvesting: Harvesting coral for commercial purposes (jewelry, souvenirs, etc) destroys reef habitats.<br><br>

Ocean acidification: This is an effect of climate change where increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes more carbonic acid to form in oceans, which increases their acidification. Increased acidity slows down formation of coral reefs, even dissolving them in severe cases. Increasing sea surface temperatures: Climate change also raises the temperature of sea surfaces. When coral reefs are exposed to these higher temperatures, they lose the algae that give the reefs their nutrition and color. This process is called “bleaching”, and frequent bleaching over time (which is inevitable due to climate change) means that the coral can’t recover from losing its nutrients and can even die off.<br><br>

The decline of coral reefs will harm animals that depend on its complex ecosystems for survival - and with about ¼ of all marine life falling into that category, that doesn’t spell good things for the ocean. Coral reefs also act as natural barriers that shield shorelines from natural disasters. They can absorb from 70%-90% of wave impact. With damaged and dying reefs, coastlines will suffer more severe effects from storms. Declining coral reefs also decrease the absorption of carbon dioxide by the ocean, which accelerates the effects of climate change.`,

    text: `In our status quo, climate change has surfaced to become a progressively prime topic among us. Along with climate change comes the topic of agroforestry, or the convention of consolidating agricultural and forestry. Numerous organizations have another say in defining agroforestry. They entitle it as intentional, intensive, integrated, and interactive farming. Either definition fits. However, the true significance of agroforestry lay not in its words but in actions. Following up is a clean, simple explanation of agroforestry’s uses, benefits, examples, and importance.<br><br>

For starters, agroforestry is arranged into three types of systems—agrisilvicultural, silvopastoral, and agrosilvopastoral. Despite the intimating long names, the three systems denote simple meanings. Agrisilvicultural systems are a fusion of crops and forestry. Silvopastoral systems are a fusion of livestock and forestry. Finally, agrosilvopastoral systems are a merge of all livestock, crop, and forestry. To complicate matters, these three systems can be subdivided into five main practices. As a preamble, these practices are known as alley cropping, wind breaks, riparian forest buffers, silvopasture, and forest farming. First, as the name suggests, alley cropping is when crops and trees are each planted in adjacent alleys or rows. This convention reduces soil and water runoff and erosion while also increasing product quality and quantity. Additionally, alley cropping promotes biodiversity and reduces use of unnecessary chemicals. Next, windbreaks are the practice of planting trees in order to harbor crops or livestock from natural menaces. In some places, winterbreaks are also known as shelterbelts or hedgerows. The most evident benefit of windbreaks are lower wind erosion levels and protection over wind-sensitive crops or livestock. Along with that, it reduces a livestock’s stress and fatality rates. To conclude with, winterbreaks also conserve energy. In contrast to windbreaks, Riparian forest buffers are regions adjacent to rivers or streams that are planted with trees. They serve as buffers and curtail detrimental runoff from the farm and secure streamsbanks. Silvopasture, which was mentioned before, is the custom of keeping both trees and livestock in the same landscape. It is best known for incrementing livestock well-being, quality, and price. Lastly, forest farming, sometimes referred to as multistory cropping, is the convention of growing crops, herbs, or botanical plants under forest canopies. It’s uses includes erecting biodiverse environments and increasing soil fertility.<br><br>

Agroforestry has numerous advantages to the farmer. First off, farmers will be spared from fretting and spending as much on water regulation, protecting crops and livestock from natural hazards, and not enough crop pollination. Those just listed are a few of the many problems agroforestry relieves. Additionally, disparate produce will accelerate pecuniary diversity and flexibility for the farmer. As for climate benefits, the trees used in agroforestry will promote carbon sequestration, soil enrichment, and biodiversity. This eco-friendly side presents agroforestry in radical contrast with monoculture farming, or the practice of farming only one crop. To sum it up, agroforestry can assist both the farmer and climate sustainability.<br><br>

While may be a new concept to many people, agroforestry has already been incorporated in many traditional communities, including those of Central America. Some Central American farmers even boast to have planted beyond 20 distinct plant species in only one-tenth of a hectare! Agroforestry has also been adopted in more recent times. For example, Northwest Vietnam has been known to use agroforestry to revive financial prosperity and refurbish their degrading lands. Their act has been encouraged by three provincial governments alongside with the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR).<br><br>

The symbiosis that agroforestry contributes can play a profound and influential role in our futures. Agroforestry can appease supply, farmer, and environmental demands. Thus, it is a versatile and flexible approach to farming that is profitable to both the farmer and the world. In contrast to monocultural farming, agroforestry is drastically more eco-friendly to our world and us. Hence, incrementing agroforestry practices will set a crucial step to mitigating the current climate crises.`,

    name: 'Effects of the Pandemic on Education',

    text: `During these uncertain times, education most definitely has changed. In an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, a coronavirus that has infected millions, many schools have moved to distance-learning. Across all seven continents, around 1.379 billion students, a figure that is around 80% of enrolled students worldwide, in over 190 countries have been impacted by this disease. Another 284 million are affeted in some way at a localized level, and 138 governments have ordered country-wide school and university closures. In order to truly comprehend the global health crisis we are currently facing, we must understand the effects the pandemic has on our education.<br><br>

For starters, due to the pandemic, tons of students are falling behind in school. One teacher from Colorado noticed that most of his students were not regularly engaged with assignments during distance-learning. Teachers want to be in a classroom with their students, where they can see the children’s progress and hold them accountable. Unfortunately, because of the current state of our world, students are logging on for only an hour each day, turning off their cameras, and staying silent. Learning from home simply is not as effective as in-person learning. This is proven in a study led by researchers at the Brookings Institute in May. They predicted that students would start the upcoming school year with less than 50% of the learning gains in mathematics. In reading, students would return with around 70% of the learning gains from the previous year. As for lower grades, students could be nearly a whole year behind in math. Distance-learning has slowed student progress in both mathematics and reading. Furthermore, the Council of Economic Advisors reported that the three months of school closures between March and May caused future projected earnings of children to decrease by 2.3-3.7 percent. If distance-learning is only half as effective as learning face-to-face in a classroom, future potential earnings will still lower by 3.5-5.5 percent. Specifically, the future earnings of a typical student will decrease by $872 annually, amounting to a $16,000 loss in lifetime earnings. This particularly targets students of color. Researchers estimated that white children would face a 1.6% reduction over 40 years, whereas black students would experience a 3.3% decrease, and Hispanic learners would encounter a 3% reduction. Remote learning is not only jeopardizing students’ education, but it is also putting their future at risk.<br><br>

In addition to that, the pandemic prevents some people from receiving a proper education, particularly minority and low-income families. Stressors, such as unemployment and/or family issues, could affect students as they return to school. For example, 23% of tertiary-enrolled respondents report a change in their employment status, while 23% state that the pandemic has caused an increase in family care responsibilities. For 28%, their desire to be near home has risen. Reports show that students from poor households are a lot less likely to finish elementary and middle school. Moreover, post-secondary students might need more financial support to be able to return to school and succeed this semester, while students who have greater caretaking responsibilities might need more flexibility in their assignment deadlines and/or attendance. Additionally, there are clear disparities in impact based on race, class, and institution type. For instance, Hispanic, Asian, and low-income respondents who earn less than $25000 each year reported plans to take fewer classes in comparison to white respondents who make roughly $75000 to $149000 per year; this could cause students to take longer to finish their programs. Low-income and Hispanic respondents are more likely to state that the pandemic impacted their re-enrollment choices, compared to upper-middle-income or white respondents. Also, some do not have access to the resources needed for distance-learning. A study conducted by Common Sense Media and the Boston Consulting Group discovered that 30% of children in public schools do not have an internet connection or a sufficient device for remote learning. On top of that, several students get inadequate assistance at home and/or do not have a quiet area to learn. These students will receive a lower-quality education.<br><br>

In summary, the pandemic has largely disrupted our education system. By denying some learners a proper education, the pandemic puts an entire generation of students in jeopardy. Simply put, distance-learning cannot compare to in-person instruction. While we should take the necessary precautions to contain the spread of COVID-19, we should also be aware of the consequences of remote learning on our education.`,

    text: `On September 26, 2020, Amy Coney Barrett was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who passed away on September 18, as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Barrett, a favorite among conservatives, was considered to replace Anthony Kennedy in 2018, but the president declared that he was “saving her” to replace Ginsberg. If confirmed, Barrett would become the fifth woman to serve on the Supreme Court and the first one who is a mother of school-aged children, and the fifth woman to serve on the court.<br><br>

Amy Coney Barrett, originally Amy Vivian Coney, was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on January 28, 1972, as the oldest of seven children. Her father was an attorney, while her mother worked as a high school French teacher. She attended St. Mary’s Dominican High School, an all-girls, private, Catholic school, and was elected as student body vice president. Barrett was then admitted into Rhodes College in Tennessee, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Majoring in English literature and minoring in French, she graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1994. Among other achievements, she was named the most outstanding graduate in the English department by the college faculty. At Notre Dame Law School, Barrett obtained a Juris Doctor degree (J.D.), summa cum laude. Here, she was the top student in her class and the Notre Dame Law Review’s executive editor, as well as a Kiley Fellow, earning the Hoynes Prize, the school’s highest honor.<br><br>

After graduating, Amy Coney Barrett was employed as a judicial law clerk for a couple of years. First, from 1997 to 1998, she clerked for Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and then from 1998 to 1999, she held a clerkship with U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. When she finished these clerkships, Barrett joined Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin, a distinguished litigation boutique firm, where she spent a year practicing law. Once the firm merged with the Texas-based firm Baker Botts, she worked there for another year, until she decided to leave for academia, the community that is associated with the pursuit of research, scholarship, and education.<br><br>

In 2002, Barrett returned to Notre Dame, her alma mater, and taught federal courts, statutory interpretation, and constitutional law. Later on, she became a law professor at the school in 2010. Not only was Barrett thrice named Distinguished Professor of the Year, but she was also the Diane and M.O. Miller II Research Chair of Law from 2014 to 2017. At the George Washington University Law School, she worked as a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and a visiting associate professor. Barrett was also a visiting associate law professor at the University of Virginia and a member of the American Law Institute (ALI). Moreover, from 2005 to 2006 and 2014 to 2017, Barrett was part of the Federalist Society. When responding to written questions during her 7th Circuit confirmation, she revealed that she rejoined the conservative legal group because it allowed her to speak to engaged and interested students on subjects of mutual interest, but claimed that she never attended the organization’s national convention.<br><br>

On May 8, 2017, Barrett was nominated to the 7th Circuit by President Trump. She gathered support from both parties at her confirmation hearing. Additionally, 450 of her former students wrote a letter to the Senate, explaining to senators that they supported Barrett not because of politics, but because they believed that she was extremely qualified. On top of that, all of her 49 Notre Dame colleagues supported her and wrote that while their political views varied, their opinion on Amy Coney Barrett was the same. She was confirmed to the 7th Circuit on October 31, 2017, by a 55 to 43 vote, with three Democratic senators (Tim Kaine, Joe Donnelly, and Joe Manchin) crossing party lines to support her.<br><br>

Amy Coney Barrett was nominated to replace Ruth Bader Ginsberg on September 26 by the president, making her his third Supreme Court nomination. This decision was backed by Mitch McConnel, Senate majority leader, as well as Senator Ted Cruz and quite a few other leaders and Senators.<br><br>

Currently, the likelihood that Barrett will be confirmed is quite high. She has received high praise from various lawyers, judges, senators, and the president himself. President Trump considered her a “woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution.” She has also been described as “an intellectual giant” who is selfless, decent, and sincere. Because of this, the American Bar Association (ABA) rated her as “well-qualified,” which is the committee’s highest rating. Beyond a disqualifying scandal, the one way that Democrats can likely prevent her nomination is for Republicans to experience an overwhelming amount of pressure from the public not to put Barrett on the Supreme Court.<br><br>

Overall, with her “staggering academic mind,” Amy Coney Barrett has the potential to be an intellectual leader and exceptional justice on the Supreme Court. According to Helen Alvaré, a professor of law at George Mason University, Barrett will be an inspiration to several generations of female academics and lawyers.`,

    text: `In Australia, Scott Morrison assumed the role of prime minister eleven days after the election. In Great Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was sworn in only a day after he was elected. In the United States, however, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. had to wait over two months before his inauguration on January 20, 2021. Why is this wait so long?<br><br>

Believe or not, the amount of time between the election and inauguration, which is referred to as the lame-duck period, used to be even longer. As the original Constitution never specified a date for the presidential inauguration, it was set by Congress. The Continental Congress decided on March 4, and although terrible weather postponed George Washington’s inauguration by eight weeks, all the other vice presidents and presidents took the oath of office on this day until 1937. And yes, the four-month long period was in fact necessary. Back in the day, it took a long time to tabulate votes and to travel to the capital. However, the extensive lame-duck session proved to be problematic. For instance, in November of 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected president, but he would not officially be president until March 4, 1861. Knowing that James Buchanan, the outgoing president, would not intervene, several Southern states began leaving the Union, beginning the Civil War before Lincoln could take office.<br><br>

By the 20th century, technological advances reduced the time needed to count votes and travel, and thus, such a long lame-duck period was no longer essential. In fact, it only caused more problems in times of national turmoil, such as the Great Depression. The president-elect, Franklin Roosevelt, and President Herbert Hoover barely communicated during Hoover’s lame-duck session, and the country was left waiting for the government to do something to control the economic devastation. As a response, the 20th Amendment, also known as the Lame Duck Amendment, was proposed. The amendment, which was ratified on January 23, 1933, moved the date of the first meeting of the Congress to January 3 and Inauguration Day to January 20. Originally, the House of Representatives wanted to change Inauguration Day to January 24, while the Senate suggested January 15. In the end, January 20 was chosen as a compromise.<br><br>

As for the venue, Thomas Jefferson became the first president to be inaugurated in Washington D.C., where almost all inaugural ceremonies are held, on March 4, 1801. Initially, inauguration took place in the Senate and House chambers of the Federal Congress. In 1817, however, a fight ensued between the House of Representatives and the Senate over which specific chairs to use in the inauguration, and so, the ceremony was held in front of the building, marking the start of the tradition of conducting the inauguration in front of Congress.<br><br>

Since the passing of the 20th Amendment, Inauguration Day has always been on January 20. That is, unless January 20 falls on a Sunday, which was the case in 1957, 1985, and 2013. If this does happen, a private swearing-in occurs on Sunday with a public ceremony the following day.`,

    author: 'Jessica Liao',
    text: `Before January 20, 2021, all but one of the vice presidents have been white men. But now, all of that has changed. As the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, Kamala D. Harris has made history as the first female, first woman of South-Asian descent, and first African-American to hold the second-highest public office in the United States.<br><br>

Born to two immigrant parents in Oakland, California, Harris is used to breaking racial and gender barriers. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in political science and economics from Howard University, a historically Black college, and earning a Juris Doctor degree (J.D.) at the University of California, Hastings, she began working at the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office. In 2003, she served as the district attorney for San Francisco, becoming the first woman and person of color to do so. Later, she was elected the first female, first Asian-American, and first African-American attorney general of California and the state’s junior United States senator, which made her the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. senate. Viewed as a rising Democratic star, Kamala Harris launched her presidential candidacy to a crowd of over 20,000, but dropped out of the race in December 2019, weeks before any votes were cast, due to her muddled responses to questions in key policy areas and inability to declare a clear reason for her campaign. But her lack of ideological rigidity made Harris ideal for the role of vice president, and in August 2020, Joe Biden selected her as his running mate.<br><br>

As Joe Biden’s pick for vice president, Kamala Harris made a concerted effort to reach out to people of color, who have stated that for the first time, they feel as though they are represented in national politics. After the vice-presidential debate in October 2020, Harris was met with familiar racist and sexist comments, which is another aspect of her experience that some of her supporters have found relatable.<br><br>

The most difficult part, however, will come after the inauguration. She will work in a space that is notorious for being dominated by white men and will probably be scrutinized more than most of the men who were vice president before her. In addition, Harris and President Biden will have to deal with a recession that has devastated the economy, a pandemic that has killed over 400,000 Americans, and a strong demand for racial justice. And because she is a woman of color, it is expected that the blowback that is bound to happen will be harsher and filled with more misogyny and racism.<br><br>

The inauguration of Kamala Harris is a historic event that has inspired women and girls across the nation. She considers her work to be connected to the civil rights leaders who preceded her as well as the generations that she strives to empower. As the embodiment of the future of a country that is growing to be more multicultural, Kamala Harris has the capability to transform the face of U.S. politics. In her first remarks as vice president-elect, she wrote, “While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last. Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.”`,

    text: `Have you heard about the reddish-orange skies that made it feel like it was the end of the world? If you live in the Bay Area, you might’ve experienced it yourself. Across the West Coast fires have burned millions of acres of land, destroying structures and giving the sky an eerie, orange hue. As of September 27, 2020, 8,100 fires in California alone have destroyed more than 7000 structures, burned over 3.7 million acres, and have caused 26 fatalities since August 15, 2020. Though the fires are the worst in California, Oregon, and Washington, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, and Montana are dealing with their own share of blazes. But what sparked these fires in the first place? And why are they so important?<br><br>

The fires were started by various causes, ranging from a gender-reveal celebration gone wrong to downed power lines. Most of them, especially in California, were started by humans. But the main reason these wildfires have become out of hand is because of climate change. Lately, the amount of extreme weather events has gone up. According to experts, this is part of the result of larger changes in temperature. So while climate change itself was not the reason for the massive wildfires, it certainly helped set the conditions for them.<br><br>

Recently, the West Coast has experienced severe heat waves. In fact, in California, which was currently in a 20-year-mega-drought, was once at 130° F (54.4° C), the highest temperature that has ever been reliably recorded. These dry and hot conditions created an ideal region for huge wildfires. Furthermore, record cold temperatures, as well as snow in nearby states, such as Colorado, have brought damaging winds. The combination of these two resulted in the severe fires we now see in the western United States. Wildfires are no stranger to those who live on the West Coast. However, the warmer temperatures and drier conditions due to climate change have caused a longer and more intense wildfire season.<br><br>

Now, the wildfires have some serious effects. Experts fear that the blazes will worsen the spread of COVID-19. Don’t be fooled into believing that the only people who are enduring poor air quality are those on the West Coast. The smoke from the blazes has reached areas far beyond the West Coast, such as the East Coast and Europe, increasing health concerns. Particles from wildfire smoke can cause airway inflammation, which leads to an increased chance of catching respiratory infections. Even if you have great lungs, they might not be able to fight off the virus if you inhale remnants from the fires.<br><br>

Additionally, since people are forced to take refuge together to flee from the fires, social distancing efforts have been jeopardized. Unfortunately, shelter crowding and the effects of breathing toxins from wildfire smoke are both major concerns. On top of that, the cloth masks used to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 will not protect you from air pollution. The best masks for wildfires are N95 masks, but since we’re in a global pandemic, there is a shortage.<br><br>

In addition to that, the wildfires have serious negative effects on the economy in the West. Thousands of buildings have been damaged, adding a strain on economic activity and creating enormous losses for property insurers. AM Best, a credit rating agency, predicts that the insured losses from the California fires could top the $13 billion from 2017 when the state experienced three of the five most expensive fires in the history of the United States. There will be extreme economic pain in the areas that have been demolished by the fires, particularly poor towns in rural California and Oregon. It doesn’t help that many areas are still suffering from the recession caused by the pandemic.<br><br>

The West Coast fires are the worst that have ever been recorded in the United States of America, and we have climate change to thank for that. The recent blazes have proven that if we don’t do something about climate change and take it seriously, we are endangering our lives and our homes. The smoke, wildfires, and oppressing heat will become a regular occurrence; it’s only a matter of time.`,

    name: 'The Black Lives Matter (BLM) Movement',

    text: `You’ve probably heard the phrase “black lives matter” recently. Following the tragic deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, it could be heard all over the United States. From protests to social media posts, hundreds of thousands of people have expressed their support for the Black community and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. But what exactly is this movement? And why is it so important right now?<br><br>

Black Lives Matter was created in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the murderer of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin. This movement, which was founded by Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrisse Cullors, began as a social media hashtag, #BlackLivesMatter. After the verdict of Zimmerman’s trial was announced, Garza explained that she felt extremely exposed, vulnerable, and enraged. In her words, “It was a verdict that said: black people are not safe in American.” She then posted a message on Facebook, which she described as a “love note to black people.” Patrisse Cullors, Garza’s close friend, saw the post and began sharing it, using the hashtag #blacklivesmatter each time she reposted. Deciding that they should create a campaign centered around the idea that Black lives matter, Garza and Cullors reached out to Opal Tometi. Together, the three women took to Twitter and Tumblr to encourage people to share stories of why #blacklivesmatter. While Alicia Garza made protest signs to place in the window of a nearby shop, Patrisse Cullors led a protest down Rodeo Drive with a banner adorned with the hashtag. And so, the slogan started to gain popularity and acceptance.<br><br>

Earlier this year, George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, died at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer, who kneeled on his neck for over eight minutes. Once videos of this incident went viral, protests erupted all over the world. Floyd’s death drew attention to the problem of racism in America and swayed the public opinion in support of Black Lives Matter.<br><br>

Of course, more popularity also brings more criticism and scrutiny. Some will respond to the movement with the phrase “all lives matter.” These people are misunderstanding the meaning of “black lives matter” and believe that the phrase implies that Black lives are more important than other lives. But that’s not true. The purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement isn’t to suggest that Black lives matter more than all other lives, but to point out that Black people are disproportionately affected by police violence. Basically, the words “black lives matter” are saying that the lives of Blacks should matter as much as the lives of white people. Claiming that “all lives matter” is pretty much ignoring the fact that Black people struggle so much more, just because of their skin color.<br><br>

Black Lives Matter has helped encourage the release of several unprecedented reports from the U.S. Department of Justice, which confirm the extensive amount of police corruption in Chicago, Cleveland, Baltimore, and Ferguson. As history’s first United States social movement to successfully utilize the internet as a tool for mass mobilization, BLM laid the groundwork for other movements such as #NeverAgain, #TimesUp, and #MeToo. It has changed the debate around the issue of police brutality and, in the words of Frank Leon Roberts, “has succeeded in transforming how Americans talk about, think about, and organize for freedom.”`,

    text: `Cryptocurrency, or crypto, is widely known as a form of online currency. Crypto technology is also decentralized—not delegated by the government or bank. The first cryptocurrency emerged in the form of Bitcoin. Bitcoin was initialized in 2008 by a pseudonymous name, Satoshi Nakamoto. Following soon, other cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Tezos, EOS, and ZCash arrived. Currently, there are 10,000 existing public types of cryptocurrency, world-wide.<br><br>

Due to cryptocurrency’s volatile and fluctuant nature, their long-term worth is often uncertain. For example, Bitcoin has once been recognized to depreciate from $20,000 to $3,200 of value. What’s more? That only occurred in one year’s time! Not to mention, there are several more occurrences when cryptocurrencies have fluctuated dramatically. Despite crypto’s volatile value, it has played an increasingly important role in our modern society. Many crypto users have been enticed with the idea utilizing a decentralized platform. To top it off, the blockchains in cryptocurrency have erected a notably sturdy and secure system.<br><br>

However, how does the actual cryptocurrency system work? The first essential factor in sustaining cryptocurrency is the “blockchain.” The blockchain is a digital ledger that documents all crypto transactions. The blockchain is further sorted into distinct “blocks.” Putting the blockchain by itself would compose an extremely frail system. Users would be able to interfere and create false transactions with ease. In order to prevent this, the ledger is designed to be public among all users. Other crypto users can impede the flow of false data by inspecting the data through a hash function, such as Bitcoin’s SHA-256. The hash function only works from one side. It is capable of checking the data but not getting the original data piece. Various “miners” will then use the hash function to verify the transactions. This part of the process involves a lot of luck and energy consumption. There are even particular hardwares designed to mine crypto. However, these hardwares are still big energy consumers. If the mining process is so distinctly tedious, then who would want to mine? Luckily, cryptocurrency is designed to give miners bits of crypto in return for their contribution. This entire mining process is defined as “proof of work.” All in all, cryptocurrency allows users to exchange currencies, miners verify transactions, and crypto is distributed to miners.<br><br>

While the inner workings of cryptocurrency can be convoluted, there are also simpler ways of entering the cryptocurrency market. Just like crypto itself, the “wallet” for cryptocurrency is located online. The wallet can be initialized and managed by someone in the middle, such as an online application or a broker.<br><br>

As crypto’s influence proliferates, cryptocurrency will be used and exchanged more frequently. As cryptocurrency nudges itself more into our lives, it is important to understand the fundamental concept and significance of it.`,

    name: 'NAFTA In a Nutshell',

    text: `On January 1 of 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement was initialized. This agreement became commonly mentioned as NAFTA. NAFTA was originally designed by George H. W. Bush as part of his Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. It's main purpose was to promote and polish commerce within North America's three big nations. In accordance with NAFTA, the United States, Mexico, and Canada could trade in the absence of taxes, tariffs, and quotas. In a nutshell, NAFTA erects a multilateral free trade zone in North America.<br><br>

As of 2019, Canada and Mexico respectively ranked second and third in the United State's list of trading partners. To provide an idea of Canada and Mexico's significance on U.S. trade, it was documented that the United States exported some one-third of its merchandise to Mexico and Canada. With the arrival of NAFTA, goods and services in North America could be exchanged tariff-free. However, not all products were allowed to be exported. In conformity with NAFTA's standards, all merchandise had to be "wholly obtained." That is to say that the merchandise must be entirely produced in one country. Nonetheless, there are loopholes to this rule. This involves meeting the rules of origin (ROO) requirements. The two chief ROO guidelines are the Tariff Shift and Regional Value Content.<br><br>

While NAFTA was already a sizable enactment, supplements to NAFTA made it even larger. Alongside with NAFTA came the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC). NAAEC ensured that all parties in its agreement administered similarly high environmental regulation. It was mainly constructed with the impetus of facilitating environmental collaboration. Additionally, NAAEC also aimed to circumvent businesses with the desire of exploiting laxer environmental standards. The NAALC functioned on a similar basis, except on the topic of labour.<br><br>

All these NAFTA accords came with an impact. The benefits were easy to predict. Most notably, North America's trilateral trade almost touched one trillion USD of value in 2016--three times the value of 1993. Statistics such as the previous suggests that NAFTA did improve trade between Mexico, Canada, and the United States. With that in mind, it would not be much of a surprise to say that NAFTA also helped the U.S.'s small and medium businesses. Additionally, GDP (the sum value of all the products and services in a country) accelerated in all three countries, predominantly the U.S. and Canada. In an analogous nature, environmental and labor regulations increased in North America. Unfortunately, NAFTA was not an entirely perfect deal. NAFTA may have caused businesses to relocate from the U.S. to Mexico, possibly with the sight of reduced labor fees in mind. This was partially due to the fact that U.S. and Mexican salaries didn't actually integrate together, as they said they would. This deficiency in action may have also invigorated the rise in Mexican immigration to the U.S. Experts aren't fully sure. Furthermore, during NAFTA, U.S. trade deficits (A deficit is when one country imports more than they export to another country) with Mexico escalated. In correspondence, inflation in the United States also increased, scaring the U.S. economy.<br><br>

Initially, experts expected NAFTA to generate some 200,000 U.S. jobs in a range of two years. This estimation was built on the idea that commerce and exports performed a prime role in the U.S. economy. However, as NAFTA itself began to unfold, controversy arose. Overall, NAFTA did improve trade growth, but hurt the U.S. economy concurrently. When the 2016 presidential campaign began, Donald Trump brought more mutiny onto the stage. Trump campaigned against NAFTA and annulled NAFTA during his presidency. In July of 2020, he then replaced NAFTA with a moderately similar United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), marking the end of NAFTA.`,
